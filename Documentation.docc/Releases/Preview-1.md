# TestFlight Release Notes

Release notes for our preview release of Xogot to TestFlight.

## Known Limitations

The most visible limitation currently is that the progress indicators in the UI
are not shown, which can be a little jarring when importing a large new project
and Xogot not responding.   This fix will be coming soon.


### Renderer
- Xogot is based on Godot 4.3, which imposes a few limitations when it comes to
  the renderers running on mobile devices (Forward+ and Mobile work, but OpenGL
  does not).   You might need to adjust your settings for your game to fully
  work on iPad.   For the final release, we will be switching to a
  Godot-4.4-based system which will support all three renderers.

- Currently we do not use the new Godot Metal-based renderer, we are hoping to
  bring it soon.

### Game Editor
- QuickOpen is missing a “Recents” tab (#87)
- Godot-native UI is not tracking the dark/light mode (#627)
- Godot-native is not using the system fonts (#176)
- IO Errors are reported with the old UI (#544)

### Inspector
- No computed expression support for numeric values (#369)
- Some buttons on embedded controls are too small (#445)
- Some warnings for controls are not shown inline (#337)
- AudioStream property inspector is missing some features (#634)

### Debugger Panel
- The debugger does not currently surface any of the performance profiling capabilities (#636)

### Output Panel
- The output panel does not display RichText output, it will render as plain text (#574)

### Exporting Projects
- Godot has a notion of Exporting projects for publishing your games.   This
  functionality is currently not exposed, but is coming up (#637).

### Features
- Motion Manager APIs are currently off, waiting on a fix  (#9)

### Running
- There is currently no support for Feature Tags when running your game (these
  are like “ifdefs”)  (#614).

### UI
- Various confirmation dialogs that will be ported over to SwiftUI remain
  written in Godot, let us know of any common ones, so we can prioritize them
  (#540) 
- Currently on the English locale is supported (#440)
- Editor Toaster Notifications are not currently shown (#383)

### Shader Globals
- It is currently not possible to edit values of sampler2D/sampler3D values
  (#147)

# Releases

## Build 1508

* When downloading samples, if the remote server does not include a
  Content-length, display a generic progress view.

* Fixes double-tapping to select on various places.

* Add support for the soft-keyboard return key accepting a completion option
  (prevously, it only worked for the physical keyboard).

* Fixed a crash spotted on Crashlytics related to Godot embedded views

* Implemented recursive "Make Resource Unique" feature for resources, it was
  missing (Crashlytics)

* Make sure that the snap value editor can be displayed, regardless of the
  toolbar position.

* Snap value editor now uses scrolling input for degrees (Internal #260, #864)

* When using the "Show Node in Tree" option in the inspector, we now use a
  different color than the selection to highlight those nodes (#817)

* SpriteFramEditor: the new editor now goes through the Godot undo/redo system,
  fixing a plethora of bugs identified.

* We now show a quick tooltip for items in the toolbar to guide users on what
  the features are (#661)

## Build 1479

* Pan and zoom events can now be used across the application together.

* Styled the editor so that breakpoints lines are more clearly visible, it used
  to be dark enough that it was unpleasant to look at.

* Code Editor: "Replace" functionality is now working (Testflight feedback)

* Prevent iOS 18.0 users from going back to the main screen, as this triggers an
  iOS 18.0 bug.

* SceneImporter: fixes the inspector in the UI, so navigation now works properly
  on that window.

* Undo operations are now reflected on the Inspector.

* Multi-touch input is now sent to Godot scripts.   Partial fix for  https://github.com/xibbon/XogotIssues/issues/24.

## Build 1465

* Interacting with embedded inspector plugins will no longer scroll the
  inspector as you scroll inside those elements. 

* Gradient previews will now properly show.

* Embedded controls on the inspector will no longer vanish

* Follow up to picking custom locations: there were a few file pickers in Godot
  that defaulted to the wrong file system location if you had picked a custom
  location. 

* Panning: panning across the Godot controls should now track the finger, as
  expected by ipad users, rather than the accelerated mode that is more suitable
  for desktop users.  This should be visible in various places that implemented
  panning in the Godot controls.

* New Text Editor Setting for completion: add type hints on/off toggle, feedback
  from Testflight.


## Build 1464

* Now renders inspector plugins for nested elements of an object.   Fixes #796.

* Prevents a crash that happened after a game was stopped.

## Build 1459

* Makes the swipe action on the ScenePad and FilePad less sensitive.

* Code completion for GDScript code is back.

## Build 1457

* Project Manager: it is now possible to select many projects and delete them in
  one go.

* Clears memory used after a game terminates, this also fixes crashes that
  happen when restarting a game (AppStore crashes)..

* Fixes an imbalance of objects, that prevents another crash from happening   
  (#833)

## Build 1452

* Due to popular demand, we now support saving your projects on a location of
  your choice, so that you are not limited to saving files into your iPad, you
  can now choose an external USB drive, iCloud drive or any other external
  locations.

* Deleting a project will now require confirmation - this is not a sign of
  weakness, but an acknowledgement that certain actions in life are
  irreversible, so we leverage the best technologies in SwiftUI to ensure that
  you have a second chance.

## Build 1449

* Fixes a crash when an object is removed via undo, while the inspector was
  still editing it.

* Fixes the issue that crashed Xogot when a game was launched, a regression
  introduced for the fix in Build 1439 for animations.

## Build 1444

* Bring back the scrolling input editors.   Sadly, this interferes with the
  swipe gestures.   So I disabled the swipe gestures on the inspector, and will
  have to figure out a good UI for it.

* Fixes the Setting crasher 

## Build 1439

* Fixes another class of crashes, this time triggered by the animation editor,
  but this is a general fix that will apply to many more scenarios (internal
  #825)

* 2D Editor: Disable rotation line, when pinch or pan event occurred, also seen
  as "Pinch to zoom causes node to move if transform tool is selected" reported
  via Testflight.

* Sets the minimum hardware requirements required by Godot, as older iPads (7th
  generation and older) do not have the GPU support that the Godot editor
  requires.

* Fixes a crash on the code editor (Crashlytics)

## Build 1433

* Fixes the scrolling not working, regression introduced in 1430 the fix is to
  loosen up the sensitivity of the swipe handlers.

## Build 1430

* Backported another Tile Editor fix

* Swipe actions on inspector properties now exposes "copy path" operation, as
  well as copy value and paste value (internal #623)

* Swipe actions on ScenePad now allow selection/deleting.

* Swipe actions on FilePad now allow selection.

* Make it easier to tap on menus in resources (it was too easy to navigate into
  the subresource, internal #737)

## Build 1425

* Groups Editor now support Global groups in addition to scene groups.

* Bring back the stricter object tracking.

* You can now type in any place in a row in the "Create New" dialog (Testflight
  report).

* In the Project Manager, the delete option is properly colored (red, internal
  #800

* Dictionaries and array editors no longer use pagiation for consistency with
  the other editors.  Internal #810.

* When deleting files from the FilePad, we will now show the user the impact
  that deleting the files would have on the project, fixes #779.

* Signals declared in scripts are show on the inspector, fixes internal #608

## Build 1415

* Fixes crash in the tile editor when painting with a physics layer.

* Create Node dialog now hides deprecated and experimental by default, but
  allows you to show them if needed.  

* Create Node dialog can be expanded to have more space to see the node types. 

* Undoes the stricter object tracking, as it has a design flaw.

## Build 1411

* Qualify of life improvement: for resources that only have a single type,
  rather than offering a "New" submenu, just inline the value, like "New
  TileSet"

* Quality of life: when pausing a program, if the program is paused and there 
  is not script to highlight, rather than showing the debugger pad, show the
  output pad, internal #772.

* We introduced a vastly stricter binding from SwiftUI to Godot in 1399, which
  will cause a few crashes in the next few days in - this version contains fixes
  for the early crashes that have been spotted.

## Build 1402

* Fixes the issue that prevented data input in text fields in sheets triggered
  from the inspector view (Public report #41), this also should fix other similar scenarios.

* Additional fixes for the new more stringent object tracking, fixes a crash
  (reported by Joseph - internal #801)

* Create Node now flags experimental and deprecated nodes.in

## Build 1399

* Fix regression that prevented the debuggee from closing its window.

* Looks: removed extra padding that was added to some BottomBar pads to leave
  room for a drag-handle, before I changed course to the current approach.

* Adds support for dropping files into Resource picker and file pickers.

* Fixes setVirtualControllerCallbacks

* Fixes a series of crashes that we tracked via Testflight related to spawning a
  game and the editor.

* Related, fixes a crash on the virtual controller that might crash.

* Implemented support for editing arrays of certain elements in the inspector -
  most notably folks reported it missing in things like TileSet (User feedback)

## Build 1387

* Fix a crash on the audio interruption handler (Testflight feedback)

* Additional telemetry to track down the MoltenVK issue that crashes on certain
  projects at startup.

* Disable Developer mode, there are lots of crashes coming from users that have
  done something behind Xogot's back, and I want to rule the reasons out.

* Launch screen: if you were in select mode, but switch to another tab,
  the select mode will be reset.

* Launch screen: long-press on a project now has a "Delete" option.

* FilePad: dragging a file into itself, or in the same directory no longer
  triggers an error.

* Bumped version to 1.0.3 to make it easier to diagnose.

* Fixes objects not being inspectable in some scenarios, tracked via Crashlytics.

## Build 1379

* Fixes the scenario where directories removed from the filepad would not be
  removed from the file listing.

* Start to roll out a system to track objects that Godot releases but that the
  UI still holds, this will help me track down the places where this is
  happening (SwiftGodot Resilience).

## Build 1375

* Fixes the issue where the controller would not work if it was paired before
  your game started.   This was finally removed as an issue from these very
  release notes! (#283)

* Restoration will no longer start with a blank screen, that turned out to be an
  attempt to restore your game - but this should not even be allowed

## Build 1372

* Completes the audio setup for the game, so audio for your game will follow the
  settings you had configured when it plays.

* Should fix the "Crashes when you close a scene" (Testflight crash/feedback)


## Build 1370

* Fixes crash on dictionary editors for unknown data types, and adds support for
  using "Objects" as keys and values in the godot editor for dictionaries.

* "Pad" menu becomes more noticeable when launching an app.

* Dirty-file indicator is now properly tracked (Discord, Testflight feedback).

* Fixes the icon alignment on the toolbars.

* Bring a visual indicator that "select mode" is active in 2D and 3D toolbars.

* Bring back the Display Type Selector in te 3DViewport options.

* Work in progress: audio modes from the game are saved when the game pauses and
  the system defaults are put back in place, and restored when the game resumes (Discord feedback).

* Built-in scripts will now get their proper name when creating them.

* Fixed scrolling on launch screen for the learning projects (Testflight
  feedback)

## Build 1360

* Updates MoltenVK to v1.2.11, hoping that this fixes a number of crashes that 
happen on startup (Testflight feedback)

* Removes an assertion for a resource that was not released (Testflight crash report)

* Reduces the FPS to 60 frames per second while using the editor, and keeps it
  at 120 while running games.   This should reduce battery usage a little, but
  there is more work to do here (Testflight feedback)

* Fixes a crash on the dictionary editor for unknown dictionary types
  (Testflight crash)

* Fixed: Attempting to scroll Godot node selection dialogs drags instead of
  scrolling (Testflight feedback).

## Build 1354

* Inspector now also capitalizes properties that use camel case, so things like
  "playerSpeed" are rendered as "Player Speed".  #10

* Adds shortcuts for select, move, rotate, scale, group, pan, ruler, lock,
  center selection, frame selection, local coords, snap.

* Compliance: states the purpose of accessing the microphone, this prevents a
  crash when trying to use games that want to record audio.  #29

* Launching Xogot will no longer interrupt audio playback.   There is still
  additional work necessary to allow games to change those settings. #37

* Property editors for dictionaries are now exposed.

## Build 1347

* Additional analytics to try to track down a crash that is happening with a
  popup, but none of the crashes have any feedback associated with it.

* Improve the numeric data input, the small arrow keys will now at least
  increment values in 0.1, instead of the hardcoded values in Godot, as
  sometimes those would be as small as 0.001 which were barelly noticeable

* Numeric Input changes: for users with keyboards using a modifier with the up
  and down arrow keys now change the value like this:

  ** Option: 0.1 units
  ** Shift: 10 units
  ** Control: 100 units

## Build 1342

* Resource pickers will now have the proper filters for the data type being
  edited, instead of defaulting to a useles default that did not show the right
  files.

## Build 1338

* Additional breadcrumbs for catching crashes.

## Build 1334

* Documentation should be rendered again

* Fixed the tab colors in the text editor, the ghost text is gone

* Help page now has proper rounded corners

## Build 1333

* Fixes crashes caused by background messages being posted to the output log

* Additional debug information for some crashes we are tracking

* Fixes double-tapping on FilePad, ScenePad and CreateDialog, once you tapped
a row, the second tap was always considered a double-tap.

* Double tap on directories toggles the directory expansion state, rather that
  opening the inspector.

* Prevents a crash on when the collision gizmo is enabled (this looks like a
  potential Godot upstream bug: c8424cfce77ca9536c7fdb0c03345a2fbcc39bba)

* List selection mode in the 3D editor is now working.

## Build 1328

* Fixes the Skeleton3D plugin editor that would lead to a crash, but this
  surfaced a series of issues related to toolbars for plugins and inspector
  plugins - all those issues have now been fixed.

* Fixes crashes stemming from partial deinitializations of the editor.

* Surfaces incomplete project properties into the Project Settings (like
  General/Wind, but will work for other properties that are only 2-levels rather
  than the standard 3-levels)

* Map Layer editor now supports Pinch and Pan.

* Enabled the Mac-command like shortcuts in Godot, rather than the default
  Windows-based ones (visible in things like "Select All" in a Godot Text
  editor, now it is Command-A rather than Control-A).

## Build 1320

* Allows cinematic preview to be disabled.

* Fixes physical keyboard input for special keys.

## Build 1317

* When selecting a file from a property in the UI, it will now use the
  configured filters by default, rather than the system default.

* Tapping "Select" on a file selector property without having picked a file will
  now reset the value to empty.

* Made the debugging control line at least 44 points tall so it is easier to tap
  the buttons there.

* Made the completion entries larger so they are easier to tap.

* Use debug builds to help us isolate a couple of crashes.

* Fixes the debugger window positioning when there is no target running.

* Added debugging symbols for the Godot component, it turns out that the
crash reports were getting very hard to see due to the lack of this information.

* Fixes the crash that was triggered when tapping on the sky or sun in the 3D
  editor, finally tracked it down.  This only happened in release builds.  A
  lovely gift from the C++ optimizer to us.

* Importer and other properties: avoid replicating the last section in
  properties with implicit categories.

## Build 1307

* Makes sure that a deprecated toolbar is not shown while editing controls.

* Does not restore Built-in script loading, like Godot does.

* Internal improvements (Godot rehosting code).

* Saves all scenes and scripts before running, to match Godot on desktop, and
  also is much better UX.

* Fixes crash on the Groups pad.

* Brings Crashlytics, hoping to find the location of some ellusive bugs being reported.

## Build 1296

* Native SpriteSheetImporter implemented.

* Fixes loading and saving of built-in scripts (those that do not have a
  separate file).

* Fixes running not picking up saved changes.

* Project Manager now offers long-press options to rename projects and launch projects.

* Fixed some ranges in the 3D toolbar light properties that were out of range
  and one property that could not be changed.

## Build 1283

* Should fix crashes related to the inspector and custom resources that were
  triggered under various different conditions.

## Build 1280

* Fixes the scenario where tapping the filepad and scenepad icons to
hide the sidebar would cause the sidebar to not be shown again (#446).

* *Did not set min/max settings for windows when resizing, which
caused runtime warnings, now we are correct (#437)

* Clip the top window, so that we do not overdraw (no bug filed, but
preemptive).

* Tracks the state of the code editor and the bottom bars, and the
last used gets the priority for the display.  The priority is very
simple, if the text editor just became the first responder, then when
the keyboard appears on the screen, we hide the bottom bar.  Fixes
#375.

* Allows the dragging handle to be used when a bottom pad is
maximized.

* It is now possible to tap anwyhere in a row on the Create New Dialog,

* Disable node 3D editor plugin mouse motion event handling if pinch or pan
  event occurred.

* Adds Command-shift-C shortcut to copy the node path

* Adds Command-Shift-[ and Command-Shift-] to go move across editor tabs.

* Style: search boxes no longer auto-capitalize.


## Build 1274

* Now it valides project names

* Fixes slow response times on dialogs, this fixes a regression from when I
  added double-tap to activate. 

* Fixes the ratio-lock button not working.

* SwiftGodot upgrade (just internal, nothing really visible)

* Fixes the popup closing errors.

* When using StageManager, there is an iPadOS bug that shows an empty bar at the
  bottom when doing text entry, so we deployed a workaround.

## Build 1260

* Font color in the filepad search is now visible in dark themes.

* A serious bug that would prevent plenty of components of Xogot to work on the
  second project opened has been fixed.   It was most obviously manifest as
  buttons or objects not responding sometimes to taps, and a "SignalProxy" error
  logged in the output window.

* Duplicate labels in the Project Settings have been fixed.

* Searching in the FilePad will automatically expand folder nodes when there are
  matches inside a closed folder.

## Build 1256

* Numeric popups no longer move as the values change.

* Additional improvements at Project Shutdown to prevent it from crashing, an
orderly shutdown has been implemented now.

## Build 1253

* Toolbar Animation icons are now displayed.

* Double-tapping on an item on the the Quick Open Dialog will open the item.

* Recent files were being saved with an incorrect filename, polluting the space.

* Fixed a crash in the CodeEditor triggering while reporting IO errors.

* Prominent Import files button in the toolbar.

* Clear option in a Resource should now clear the value.


## Build 1245

* Adds 3D editor, "Align Transform with View" and "Align Rotation with View" are
  now available on the viewport menu.

* Reliability: many scenarios that crashed where going back to the "Project
  List" are fixed, this is the result of a long-term effort, and the proper
  solution just landed.

## Build 1237

* 3D Node Editor, surface the "Use Local Space" coordinate option to the toolbar

* Fixes the text input in the inspector

* If you have a node selected in the scenepad and tap the "Script" icon at the
  top automatically load that script (only happens if you do not have any
  scripts opened).

* Quick Open dialog, Pick scene dialog, sprite frame editor: tapping anywhere in
  the row selects the row, not just the part with the text.

* "Run Specific Scene" and "Run Current Scene" work now, they were always
  running the main scene.

* You can now select the new SpriteFrameEditor from the settings menu.


## Build 1230

* Fixes the bug where if you were running your game in full screen, the stop
  button would not stop it.

* Disabled localization of Godot (it was mixing English and your local
  language), for now only English is supported.

* Double tapping on a row in the "Create New Node" will create the item,
    without having to tap "Add"
