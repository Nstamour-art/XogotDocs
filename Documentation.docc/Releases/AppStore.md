# AppStore Release Notes

Release notes for public releases of Xogot to the App Store.

# Releases 

## 1.4.0

This version has been upgraded to use Liquid Glass on iOS 26 and iPadOS 26.

This released also vastly improves our iPhone support, lots of UI elements were
fine tuned for use on the iPhone, our inspector is now a slide-out element
freeing the bottom of the screen for the various custom Godot plugins.

Lastly, Xogot has been localized into nine languages, with more to come.

### Improvements

* Performance improvement to node selection - internally we stopped doing a lot
  fo work when scanning for plugins for a node (#1108).

* By popular demand: New "Reload Current Project" option is now on the menus,
  used when certain settings are changed.   I am not psyched about this extra
  menu that replaces Close + Open, but it seems to be a common enough idiom in
  Godot that seems important to bring.

* Numeric editors should surface sliders in more places now.

## 1.2.0 (Build 2757), 1.2.2 (Build 2819)

Two major themes.   Xogot comes to iPhone, and we now have a free tier edition,
check our blog post for additional details.

## Improvements

* New 'use_hidpi' setting under the display/window/stretch settings, which is
  independent of the previous attempt we had to support HIDPI by extending the
  meaning of the 'display/window/stretch/scale_mode' to have an 'auto' mode,
  which was not compatible with Desktop Godot.

* It is now possible to edit the labels of collission masks - the feature had
  not been wired up before (Discord, #1488)

* Double-tapping a node in the create node dialog will create the node, this
  makes it consistent with the existing behavior in the "All" tree-view that
  allowed this behavior (#1481).

* Dropping files from the file pad into the scene pad should work if you drop in
  an empty region, and not just when you drop on top of an existing node
  (Discord, #1492).

* We completed a memory leak journey, we have been chasing some pesky memory
  leaks when closing a project and going back to the main screen.   This will
  also improve the reliability after closing a project, because these dangling
  objects kept running for a little while after the editor closed, and this
  should no longer happen.

* True and false keywords should now be highlighted (Discord, #1491)

* Import button on the toolbar now shows a menu, which will help users determine
  that this is an import operation with a label, and adding a simple option to
  import Photos from the user's photo library (#1482).

* Rectangle Editor: in a few places, the rectangle editor will now display
  'Edit Rectangle' and when pressed, it will show up an
  interactive view to select a region from the image (Discord, #1465).

* SpriteSheetImport: will now remember the settings that you had when importing
  a new texture if the size of the texture matches the previous size (Discord
  request).
  
* Grouped numeric input: we will now auto-select in the popup the entry that you
  tapped on (Discord).

* UI consistency: in places where we guide our users to the next step, rather
  than rolling our own UI, we now use the system ContentUnavailableView idiom
  for more consistency.

* Better support for iOS 2026 user interface, even if it is not using those APIs
  just yet. 

* The virtual controllers that are displayed when you start a game automatically
  hide if you switch out of the "Game" mode (#1282)

* It is now possible to start a new chat from the Chat window.

* Add ability to extract TileMapLayer from TileMap #1509

* You can now configure in Xogot Settings your default execution target, either
  the embedded window, or a separate window.   

* You can now copy the error message when there is a runtime error (#1122)

* Happier colors for the launch screen, it was making me sad, and additionally
  Axolotl Rex will greet you on your gaming journey.

* You can now change the font for the code editor and consume system fonts, my
  previous attempt merely allowed you to pick a different fixed font, now you
  can pick any user-installed fonts (#1539, Discord).

The TileMap and TileSet plugins can now be docked on the left or right sides,
  to assist in your editing needs (#1529, Discord)

* Added keyboard shortcuts for various operations (Cut, Copy, Delete, Duplicate
  Nodes and Select All).   Some of these shortcuts might only be visible on iOS
  26, as they are exposed via the built-in system commands (#1549, Discord).

* Animation editor tab: significant performance improvements when switching
  animations and when playing back animations (#1562, Discord).


* TextureRegionEditor will now auto-size to a convenient size, and the handles
  will be scaled accordingly.   Plus various small improvements to it (#1557)

* When switching an animation, stop a playing animation (#1561)


* Expression Evaluator: The Godot REPL is now available in Xogot (#1412), there
  is a new option that you can toggle on the bottom of the screen when the
  debugger is selected to switch to the REPL window.

* Inspector: reviewed the padding of some elements and discovered a handful of
  pixels here and there that were needlessly consuming space that was needed.   

* Reparenting of nodes will now report an error if you are editing a foreign
  scene, and the operation is not allowed (Discord).  My preference would have
  been to remove the menu, but new Apple guidance on menus is to not make menus
  conditional, so we are going to start moving into that direction.

* On an empty scene, the "Other Node" or tapping the "+" sign will bring up the
  new node selection dialog, rather than defaulting to the limited tree-view
  one (#1501)

* The reference guide now has an index to search by words in the documetnation
  (#1379, Discord).


* Reference Guide: when searching for keywords, it now allows multiple words to
  be specified, requiring all matches to be present, as well as the notation
  "-word" to exclude any matches containing that word.

* Added keyboard shortcuts to increase and decreate the text editor font size
  using Command-Shift-minus and Command-shift-plus.  (Discord, #1323)

* Provides visual guidance that the editor is closing down a project when you go
  back to the main screen (#1454).

* The Free Edition will now have the debugger available, but will limit the
  project size.

* Added support for sub-property picking in the AnimationPlayer - be warned that
  while both Xogot and Godot support this, the feature is not fully baked in
  Godot, and has various limitations:
  https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/99115
  
* Godot native popovers now use our Floating Window (the feature part of a bug
  request #1531).


* The Animation Player editor previously had a number of options under the menu
  for the animation, but there was also an "Options" menu for one single task,
  so I unified those.

* For built games, if the game uses audio permissions, it will ask before
  launching, to make sure you have permissions to use those features (Completes
  the last part of #1456).


## 1.1.2 (Build 2413)
