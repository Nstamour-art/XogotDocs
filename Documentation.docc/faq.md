Frequently Asked Questions

## Why does Xogot seem to lock up when opening my project?

It can take a while to re-import assets for your project to the iPad, and one of
Xogot's most visible limitation currently is that the progress indicators in the
UI are not shown, which can be a little jarring when importing a large new
project and Xogot not responding.   

It may take an unexpectedly long time for the project to load.  A fix will be
coming soon.

## Why can I not see my game when my project loads?

If you open your project Xogot and your viewport is missing (as in the image
below), you might need to adjust your settings for your game to fully work on
iPad.

Xogot is based on Godot 4.3, which imposes a few limitations when it
comes to the renderers running on mobile devices (Forward+ and Mobile work,
but OpenGL does not).   

To configure a compatible renderer, refer to this screenshot and follow the 
steps below:

1. Tap on the switch button in the top-right corner of the app and select "Settings"  
2. Scroll to the Rendering section on the left-hand column and tap "Renderer" 
3. Make sure that Rendering Method.mobile is not set to OpenGL
4. Once you have selected a compatible mobile renderer, close and re-open the project

For the final release, we will be switching to a Godot-4.4-based system which
will support all three renderers.

## Why does my game show more of the canvas than it’s supposed to when running?

This issue might be caused by incorrect stretch settings. To resolve it:

1. Tap on the switch button in the top-right corner of the app and select "Settings"
2. Scroll to the Display section on the left-hand column and tap "Window"
3. Scroll to the Stretch section and select a Mode of either "viewport" or "canvas_items."  

These modes will clip overflow and ensure that the game view is scaled correctly 
for the available screen space.


## Why is my TestFlight invite is expired, invalid, or having other issues?
The most likely issue is that you used a different email address than your 
Apple ID to sign up for the beta, or a new preview build was published after
your invite was sent.  

For any issues related to accessing builds on TestFlight, please 
[Contact Us](https://xogot.com/contact-us) and provide the email
address associated with your Apple account.
