# Exporting for Windows

The simplest way to distribute a game for PC is to copy the executable
(godot.exe), compress the folder and send it to someone else. However, this
is often not desired.

Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the export
system. When exporting for Windows, the exporter takes all the project files and
creates a data.pck file. This file is bundled with a specially optimized
binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the editor and debugger.

## Changing the executable icon

Godot will automatically use whatever image is set as your project's icon in the project
settings, and convert it to an ICO file for the exported project. If you want to
manually create an ICO file for greater control over how the icon looks at different
resolutions then see the <doc:changing_application_icon_for_windows> page.

## Code signing

Godot is capable of automatic code signing on export. To do this you must have the
Windows SDK (on Windows) or osslsigncode
(on any other OS) installed. You will also need a package signing certificate,
information on creating one can be found here.

> Warning:
>
> If you export for Windows with embedded PCK files, you will not be able to

> On Windows, PCK embedding is also known to cause false positives in
> antivirus programs. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using it unless
> you're distributing your project via Steam as it bypasses code signing and
> antivirus checks.

### Setup

Settings need to be changed in two places. First, in the editor settings, under
**Export > Windows**. Click on the folder next to the Sign Tool setting, if
you're using Windows navigate to and select SignTool.exe, if you're on a different
OS select osslsigncode.

The second location is the Windows export preset, which can be found in
**Project > Export...**. Add a windows desktop preset if you haven't already.
Under options there is a code signing category.

Enabled must be set to true, and Identity must be set to the signing
certificate. The other settings can be adjusted as needed. Once this is Done
Godot will sign your project on export.

## Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables to set export options outside of
the editor. During the export process, these override the values that you set in
the export menu.

Export option | Environment variable
------------- | --------------------
Encryption / Encryption Key | GODOT_SCRIPT_ENCRYPTION_KEY
Options / Codesign / Identity Type | GODOT_WINDOWS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY_TYPE
Options / Codesign / Identity | GODOT_WINDOWS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY
Options / Codesign / Password | GODOT_WINDOWS_CODESIGN_PASSWORD

## Export options

You can find a full list of export options available in the
[EditorExportPlatformWindows](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_editorexportplatformwindows.html#class-editorexportplatformwindows) class reference.
