## Threads

Threads allow simultaneous execution of code. It allows off-loading work
from the main thread.

Godot supports threads and provides many handy functions to use them.

## Creating a Thread

To create a thread, use the following code:

```
var thread: Thread

# The thread will start here.
func _ready():
    thread = Thread.new()
    # You can bind multiple arguments to a function Callable.
    thread.start(_thread_function.bind("Wafflecopter"))


# Run here and exit.
# The argument is the bound data passed from start().
func _thread_function(userdata):
    # Print the userdata ("Wafflecopter")
    print("I'm a thread! Userdata is: ", userdata)


# Thread must be disposed (or "joined"), for portability.
func _exit_tree():
    thread.wait_to_finish()
```

Your function will, then, run in a separate thread until it returns.
Even if the function has returned already, the thread must collect it, so call
[Thread.wait_to_finish()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_thread.html#class-thread-method-wait-to-finish), which will
wait until the thread is done (if not done yet), then properly dispose of it.

> Warning:

> Creating threads is a slow operation, especially on Windows. To avoid
> unnecessary performance overhead, make sure to create threads before heavy
> processing is needed instead of creating threads just-in-time.
>
> For example, if you need multiple threads during gameplay, you can create
> threads while the level is loading and only actually start processing with
> them later on.
>
> Additionally, locking and unlocking of mutexes can also be an expensive
> operation. Locking should be done carefully; avoid locking too often (or for
> too long).

## Mutexes

Accessing objects or data from multiple threads is not always supported (if you
do it, it will cause unexpected behaviors or crashes). Read the
<doc:thread_safe_apis> documentation to understand which engine APIs
support multiple thread access.

When processing your own data or calling your own functions, as a rule, try to
avoid accessing the same data directly from different threads. You may run into
synchronization problems, as the data is not always updated between CPU cores
when modified. Always use a [Mutex](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_mutex.html#class-mutex) when accessing
a piece of data from different threads.

When calling [Mutex.lock()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_mutex.html#class-mutex-method-lock), a thread ensures that
all other threads will be blocked (put on suspended state) if they try to lock
the same mutex. When the mutex is unlocked by calling
[Mutex.unlock()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_mutex.html#class-mutex-method-unlock), the other threads will be
allowed to proceed with the lock (but only one at a time).

Here is an example of using a Mutex:

```
var counter := 0
var mutex: Mutex
var thread: Thread


# The thread will start here.
func _ready():
    mutex = Mutex.new()
    thread = Thread.new()
    thread.start(_thread_function)

    # Increase value, protect it with Mutex.
    mutex.lock()
    counter += 1
    mutex.unlock()


# Increment the value from the thread, too.
func _thread_function():
    mutex.lock()
    counter += 1
    mutex.unlock()


# Thread must be disposed (or "joined"), for portability.
func _exit_tree():
    thread.wait_to_finish()
    print("Counter is: ", counter) # Should be 2.
```

## Semaphores

Sometimes you want your thread to work "on demand". In other words, tell it
when to work and let it suspend when it isn't doing anything.
For this, [Semaphores](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_semaphore.html#class-semaphore) are used. The function
[Semaphore.wait()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_semaphore.html#class-semaphore-method-wait) is used in the thread to
suspend it until some data arrives.

The main thread, instead, uses
[Semaphore.post()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_semaphore.html#class-semaphore-method-post) to signal that data is
ready to be processed:

```
var counter := 0
var mutex: Mutex
var semaphore: Semaphore
var thread: Thread
var exit_thread := false


# The thread will start here.
func _ready():
    mutex = Mutex.new()
    semaphore = Semaphore.new()
    exit_thread = false

    thread = Thread.new()
    thread.start(_thread_function)


func _thread_function():
    while true:
        semaphore.wait() # Wait until posted.

        mutex.lock()
        var should_exit = exit_thread # Protect with Mutex.
        mutex.unlock()

        if should_exit:
            break

        mutex.lock()
        counter += 1 # Increment counter, protect with Mutex.
        mutex.unlock()


func increment_counter():
    semaphore.post() # Make the thread process.


func get_counter():
    mutex.lock()
    # Copy counter, protect with Mutex.
    var counter_value = counter
    mutex.unlock()
    return counter_value


# Thread must be disposed (or "joined"), for portability.
func _exit_tree():
    # Set exit condition to true.
    mutex.lock()
    exit_thread = true # Protect with Mutex.
    mutex.unlock()

    # Unblock by posting.
    semaphore.post()

    # Wait until it exits.
    thread.wait_to_finish()

    # Print the counter.
    print("Counter is: ", counter)
```
