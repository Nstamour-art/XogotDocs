# Using an external text editor

This page explains how to code using an external text editor.

Godot can be used with an external text editor, such as Sublime Text or Visual
Studio Code. Browse to the relevant editor settings:
**Editor > Editor Settings > Text Editor > External**

@Image(source: "editor_external_editor_settings.png", alt: "Text Editor > External section of the Editor Settings") {**Text Editor > External** section of the Editor Settings}

There are two text fields: the executable path and command-line flags. The flags
allow you to integrate the editor with Godot, passing it the file path to open
and other relevant arguments. Godot will replace the following placeholders in
the flags string:

Field in Exec Flags | Is replaced with
------------------- | ----------------
{project} | The absolute path to the project directory
{file} | The absolute path to the file
{col} | The column number of the error
{line} | The line number of the error

Some example **Exec Flags** for various editors include:

Editor | Exec Flags
------ | ----------
Geany/Kate | {file}--line{line}--column{col}
Atom | {file}:{line}
JetBrains Rider | {project}--line{line} {file}
Visual Studio Code | {project}--goto{file}:{line}:{col}
Vim (gVim) | "+callcursor({line},{col})"{file}
Emacs | emacs+{line}:{col}{file}
Sublime Text | {project}{file}:{line}:{col}
Visual Studio* | /edit "file"

*: Arguments are not automatically detected, so you must fill them in manually.

Since Godot 4.5, **Exec Flags** are automatically detected for all editors
listed above (unless denoted with an asterisk). You don't need to paste them
from this page for it to work, unless your editor has an executable name not
recognized automatically (e.g. a fork of an editor listed here).

## Automatically reloading your changes

To have the Godot Editor automatically reload any script that has been changed by an external text editor,
enable **Editor > Editor Settings > Text Editor > Behavior > Auto Reload Scripts on External Change**.

## Using External Editor in Debugger

Using external editor in debugger is determined by a separate option in settings.
For details, see <doc:debugger_tools_and_options>.

## Official editor plugins

We have official plugins for the following code editors:

- Visual Studio Code

- Emacs

## LSP/DAP support

Godot supports the Language Server Protocol (**LSP**) for code completion and the Debug Adapter Protocol (**DAP**) for debugging. You can check the LSP client list and DAP client list to find if your editor supports them. If this is the case, you should be able to take advantage of these features without the need of a custom plugin.

To use these protocols, a Godot instance must be running on your current project. You should then configure your editor to communicate to the running adapter ports in Godot, which by default are 6005 for **LSP**, and 6006 for **DAP**. You can change these ports and other settings in the **Editor Settings**, under the **Network > Language Server** and **Network > Debug Adapter** sections respectively.

Below are some configuration steps for specific editors:

### Visual Studio Code

You need to install the official Visual Studio Code plugin.

For **LSP**, follow these instructions to change the default LSP port. The connection status can be checked on the status bar:

For **DAP**, specify the debugServer property in your launch.json file:

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "GDScript Godot",
            "type": "godot",
            "request": "launch",
            "project": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "port": 6007,
            "debugServer": 6006,
        }
    ]
}
```

### Emacs

Check the official instructions to configure LSP, and DAP.
