# Using the SurfaceTool

The [SurfaceTool](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_surfacetool.html#class-surfacetool) provides a useful interface for constructing geometry.
The interface is similar to the [ImmediateMesh](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_immediatemesh.html#class-immediatemesh) class. You
set each per-vertex attribute (e.g. normal, uv, color) and then when you add a vertex it
captures the attributes.

The SurfaceTool also provides some useful helper functions like index() and generate_normals().

Attributes are added before each vertex is added:

When finished generating your geometry with the [SurfaceTool](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_surfacetool.html#class-surfacetool),
call commit() to finish generating the mesh. If an [ArrayMesh](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_arraymesh.html#class-arraymesh) is passed
to commit(), then it appends a new surface to the end of the ArrayMesh. While if nothing is passed
in, commit() returns an ArrayMesh.

The code below creates a triangle without indices.

You can optionally add an index array, either by calling add_index() and adding
vertices to the index array manually, or by calling index() once,
which generates the index array automatically and
shrinks the vertex array to remove duplicate vertices.

Similarly, if you have an index array, but you want each vertex to be unique (e.g. because
you want to use unique normals or colors per face instead of per-vertex), you can call deindex().

If you don't add custom normals yourself, you can add them using generate_normals(), which should
be called after generating geometry and before committing the mesh using commit() or
commit_to_arrays(). Calling generate_normals(true) will flip the resulting normals. As a side
note, generate_normals() only works if the primitive type is set to Mesh.PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES.

You may notice that normal mapping or other material properties look broken on
the generated mesh. This is because normal mapping **requires** the mesh to
feature tangents, which are separate from normals. You can either add custom
tangents manually, or generate them automatically with
generate_tangents(). This method requires that each vertex have UVs and
normals set already.

By default, when generating normals, they will be calculated on a per-vertex basis (i.e. they will
be "smooth normals"). If you want flat vertex normals (i.e. a single normal vector per face), when
adding vertices, call add_smooth_group(i) where i is a unique number per vertex.
add_smooth_group() needs to be called while building the geometry, e.g. before the call to
add_vertex().
