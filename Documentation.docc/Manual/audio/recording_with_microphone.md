# Recording with microphone

Godot supports in-game audio recording for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and
iOS.

On iOS and iPadOS, it is important for your application to set the proper flags
for the audio session.  Visit the Project Settings in Xogot, and then tap "Show
Advanced", and then select Audio/General on the settings and look for "Session
Category".   Make sure that you set the category to "Record" or "Play and
Record", as this will inform the operating system of your intended use of the
audio system.

It is possible that you get an error like `AudioOutputUnitStart failed, code
2003329396`, this indicates that your Audio Session Category is not correctly set.

A simple demo is included in the official demo projects and will be used as
support for this tutorial:
https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/audio/mic_record.

You will need to enable audio input in the [Audio > Driver > Enable Input](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_projectsettings.html#class-projectsettings-property-audio-driver-enable-input) project setting, or you'll just get empty audio files.

## The structure of the demo

The demo consists of a single scene. This scene includes two major parts: the
GUI and the audio.

We will focus on the audio part. In this demo, a bus named `Record` with the
effect `Record` is created to handle the audio recording.
An `AudioStreamPlayer` named `AudioStreamRecord` is used for recording.

```
var effect
var recording


func _ready():
    # We get the index of the "Record" bus.
    var idx = AudioServer.get_bus_index("Record")
    # And use it to retrieve its first effect, which has been defined
    # as an "AudioEffectRecord" resource.
    effect = AudioServer.get_bus_effect(idx, 0)
```

The audio recording is handled by the [AudioEffectRecord](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_audioeffectrecord.html#class-audioeffectrecord) resource
which has three methods:
[get_recording()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_audioeffectrecord.html#class-audioeffectrecord-method-get-recording),
[is_recording_active()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_audioeffectrecord.html#class-audioeffectrecord-method-is-recording-active),
and [set_recording_active()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_audioeffectrecord.html#class-audioeffectrecord-method-set-recording-active).

```
func _on_record_button_pressed():
    if effect.is_recording_active():
        recording = effect.get_recording()
        $PlayButton.disabled = false
        $SaveButton.disabled = false
        effect.set_recording_active(false)
        $RecordButton.text = "Record"
        $Status.text = ""
    else:
        $PlayButton.disabled = true
        $SaveButton.disabled = true
        effect.set_recording_active(true)
        $RecordButton.text = "Stop"
        $Status.text = "Recording..."
```

At the start of the demo, the recording effect is not active. When the user
presses the `RecordButton`, the effect is enabled with
`set_recording_active(true)`.

On the next button press, as `effect.is_recording_active()` is `true`,
the recorded stream can be stored into the `recording` variable by calling
`effect.get_recording()`.

```
func _on_play_button_pressed():
    print(recording)
    print(recording.format)
    print(recording.mix_rate)
    print(recording.stereo)
    var data = recording.get_data()
    print(data.size())
    $AudioStreamPlayer.stream = recording
    $AudioStreamPlayer.play()
```

To playback the recording, you assign the recording as the stream of the
`AudioStreamPlayer` and call `play()`.

```
func _on_save_button_pressed():
    var save_path = $SaveButton/Filename.text
    recording.save_to_wav(save_path)
    $Status.text = "Saved WAV file to: %s\n(%s)" % [save_path, ProjectSettings.globalize_path(save_path)]
```

To save the recording, you call `save_to_wav()` with the path to a file.
In this demo, the path is defined by the user via a `LineEdit` input box.
