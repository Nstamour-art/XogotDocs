# Particle shaders

Particle shaders are a special type of shader that runs before the object is
drawn. They are used for calculating material properties such as color,
position, and rotation. They are drawn with any regular material for CanvasItem
or Spatial, depending on whether they are 2D or 3D.

Particle shaders are unique because they are not used to draw the object itself;
they are used to calculate particle properties, which are then used by a
<doc:canvas_item_shader> or <doc:spatial_shader>
shader. They contain two processor functions: start() and process().

Unlike other shader types, particle shaders keep the data that was output the
previous frame. Therefore, particle shaders can be used for complex effects that
take place over multiple frames.

## Render modes

Render mode | Description
----------- | -----------
**keep_data** | Do not clear previous data on restart.
**disable_force** | Disable attractor force.
**disable_velocity** | IgnoreVELOCITYvalue.
**collision_use_scale** | Scale the particle's size for collisions.

## Built-ins

Values marked as in are read-only. Values marked as out can optionally be written to and will
not necessarily contain sensible values. Values marked as inout provide a sensible default
value, and can optionally be written to. Samplers cannot be written to so they are not marked.

## Global built-ins

Global built-ins are available everywhere, including custom functions.

Built-in | Description
-------- | -----------
in float**TIME** | Global time since the engine has started, in seconds. It repeats after every3,600seconds (which can  be changed with the
[rollover](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_projectsettings_property_rendering/limits/time/time_rollover_secs.html#class-projectsettings_property_rendering/limits/time/time_rollover_secs)
setting). It's affected by
[time_scale](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_engine_property_time_scale.html#class-engine_property_time_scale) but not by pausing. If you need aTIMEvariable that is not affected by time scale, add your own
<doc:shading_language#Global-Uniforms> and update it each
frame.
in float**PI** | APIconstant (3.141592).
A ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and amount of radians in half turn.
in float**TAU** | ATAUconstant (6.283185).

## Process functions

emit_subparticle() is currently the only custom function supported by
particles shaders. It allows users to add a new particle with specified
parameters from a sub-emitter. The newly created particle will only use the
properties that match the flags parameter. For example, the
following code will emit a particle with a specified position, velocity, and
color, but unspecified rotation, scale, and custom value:

```
mat4 custom_transform = mat4(1.0);
custom_transform[3].xyz = vec3(10.5, 0.0, 4.0);
emit_subparticle(custom_transform, vec3(1.0, 0.5, 1.0), vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0), vec4(1.0), FLAG_EMIT_POSITION | FLAG_EMIT_VELOCITY | FLAG_EMIT_COLOR);
```

Function | Description
-------- | -----------
bool**emit_subparticle**(mat4 xform, vec3 velocity, vec4 color, vec4 custom, uint flags) | Emits a particle from a sub-emitter.
