# CanvasItem shaders

CanvasItem shaders are used to draw all 2D elements in Godot. These include
all nodes that inherit from CanvasItems, and all GUI elements.

CanvasItem shaders contain fewer built-in variables and functionality than
<doc:spatial_shader>, but they maintain the same basic structure
with vertex, fragment, and light processor functions.

## Render modes

Render mode | Description
----------- | -----------
**blend_mix** | Mix blend mode (alpha is transparency), default.
**blend_add** | Additive blend mode.
**blend_sub** | Subtractive blend mode.
**blend_mul** | Multiplicative blend mode.
**blend_premul_alpha** | Pre-multiplied alpha blend mode.
**blend_disabled** | Disable blending, values (including alpha) are written as-is.
**unshaded** | Result is just albedo. No lighting/shading happens in material.
**light_only** | Only draw on light pass.
**skip_vertex_transform** | VERTEXneeds to be transformed manually in thevertex()function.
**world_vertex_coords** | VERTEXis modified in world coordinates instead of local.

## Built-ins

Values marked as in are read-only. Values marked as out can optionally be written to and will
not necessarily contain sensible values. Values marked as inout provide a sensible default
value, and can optionally be written to. Samplers cannot be written to so they are not marked.

Not all built-ins are available in all processing functions. To access a vertex
built-in from the fragment() function, you can use a <doc:shading_language#Varyings>.
The same applies for accessing fragment built-ins from the light() function.

## Global built-ins

Global built-ins are available everywhere, including custom functions.

Built-in | Description
-------- | -----------
in float**TIME** | Global time since the engine has started, in seconds. It repeats after every3,600seconds (which can  be changed with the
[rollover](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_projectsettings_property_rendering/limits/time/time_rollover_secs.html#class-projectsettings_property_rendering/limits/time/time_rollover_secs)
setting). It's affected by
[time_scale](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_engine_property_time_scale.html#class-engine_property_time_scale) but not by pausing. If you need aTIMEvariable that is not affected by time scale, add your own
<doc:shading_language#Global-Uniforms> and update it each
frame.
in float**PI** | APIconstant (3.141592).
A ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and amount of radians in half turn.
in float**TAU** | ATAUconstant (6.283185).
An equivalent ofPI * 2and amount of radians in full turn.
in float**E** | AnEconstant (2.718281).
Euler's number and a base of the natural logarithm.

## Vertex built-ins

Vertex data (VERTEX) is presented in local space (pixel coordinates, relative to the Node2D's origin).
If not written to, these values will not be modified and be passed through as they came.

The user can disable the built-in model to world transform (world to screen and projection will still
happen later) and do it manually with the following code:

```
shader_type canvas_item;
render_mode skip_vertex_transform;

void vertex() {

    VERTEX = (MODEL_MATRIX * vec4(VERTEX, 0.0, 1.0)).xy;
}
```

Other built-ins, such as UV and COLOR, are also passed through to the fragment() function if not modified.

For instancing, the INSTANCE_CUSTOM variable contains the instance custom data. When using particles, this information
is usually:

- **x**: Rotation angle in radians.

- **y**: Phase during lifetime (0.0 to 1.0).

- **z**: Animation frame.

Built-in | Description
-------- | -----------
in mat4**MODEL_MATRIX** | Local space to world space transform. World space
is the coordinates you normally use in the editor.
in mat4**CANVAS_MATRIX** | World space to canvas space transform. In canvas
space the origin is the upper-left corner of the
screen and coordinates ranging from(0.0, 0.0)to viewport size.
in mat4**SCREEN_MATRIX** | Canvas space to clip space. In clip space
coordinates ranging from(-1.0,-1.0)to(1.0, 1.0).

in bool**AT_LIGHT_PASS** | Alwaysfalse.
in vec2**TEXTURE_PIXEL_SIZE** | Normalized pixel size of default 2D texture.

[modulate](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvasitem_property_modulate.html#class-canvasitem_property_modulate)
multiplied by CanvasItem's
[self_modulate](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvasitem_property_self_modulate.html#class-canvasitem_property_self_modulate).
inout float**POINT_SIZE** | Point size for point drawing.
in vec4**CUSTOM0** | Custom value from vertex primitive.
in vec4**CUSTOM1** | Custom value from vertex primitive.

## Fragment built-ins

### COLOR and TEXTURE

The built-in variable COLOR is used for a few things:

- In the vertex() function, COLOR contains the color from the vertex
primitive multiplied by the CanvasItem's
[modulate](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvasitem_property_modulate.html#class-canvasitem_property_modulate) multiplied by the
CanvasItem's [self_modulate](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvasitem_property_self_modulate.html#class-canvasitem_property_self_modulate).

- In the fragment() function, the input value COLOR is that same value
multiplied by the color from the default TEXTURE (if present).

- In the fragment() function, COLOR is also the final output.

Certain nodes (for example, [Sprite2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite2d.html#class-sprite2d)) display a texture
by default, for example [texture](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite2d_property_texture.html#class-sprite2d_property_texture). When
using a custom fragment() function, you have a few options on how to sample
this texture.

To read only the contents of the default texture, ignoring the vertex COLOR:

```
void fragment() {
  COLOR = texture(TEXTURE, UV);
}
```

To read the contents of the default texture multiplied by vertex COLOR:

```
void fragment() {
  // Equivalent to an empty fragment() function, since COLOR is also the output variable.
  COLOR = COLOR;
}
```

To read only the vertex COLOR in fragment(), ignoring the main texture,
you must pass COLOR as a varying, then read it in fragment():

```
varying vec4 vertex_color;
void vertex() {
  vertex_color = COLOR;
}
void fragment() {
  COLOR = vertex_color;
}
```

### NORMAL

Similarly, if a normal map is used in the [CanvasTexture](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvastexture.html#class-canvastexture), Godot uses
it by default and assigns its value to the built-in NORMAL variable. If you are using a normal
map meant for use in 3D, it will appear inverted. In order to use it in your shader, you must assign
it to the NORMAL_MAP property. Godot will handle converting it for use in 2D and overwriting NORMAL.

```
NORMAL_MAP = texture(NORMAL_TEXTURE, UV).rgb;
```

Built-in | Description
-------- | -----------
in vec4**FRAGCOORD** | Coordinate of pixel center. In screen space.xyspecifies
position in viewport. Upper-left of the viewport is the
origin,(0.0, 0.0).
in vec2**SCREEN_PIXEL_SIZE** | Size of individual pixels. Equal to inverse of resolution.
in vec4**REGION_RECT** | Visible area of the sprite region in format(x, y, width, height). Varies according to
Sprite2D'sregion_enabledproperty.
in vec2**POINT_COORD** | Coordinate for drawing points.

in vec2**TEXTURE_PIXEL_SIZE** | Normalized pixel size of default 2D texture.
For a Sprite2D with a texture of size 64x32px,TEXTURE_PIXEL_SIZE=vec2(1/64, 1/32)
in bool**AT_LIGHT_PASS** | Alwaysfalse.
sampler2D**SPECULAR_SHININESS_TEXTURE** | Specular shininess texture of this object.
in vec4**SPECULAR_SHININESS** | Specular shininess color, as sampled from the texture.
in vec2**UV** | UV from thevertex()function.
For Sprite2D with region enabled, this will sample the entire
texture. UseREGION_RECTinstead to sample only the
region defined in the Sprite2D's properties.
in vec2**SCREEN_UV** | Screen UV coordinate for current pixel.
sampler2D**SCREEN_TEXTURE** | Removed in Godot 4. Use asampler2Dwithhint_screen_textureinstead.

overridesNORMAL.
out float**NORMAL_MAP_DEPTH** | Normal map depth for scaling.
inout vec2**VERTEX** | Pixel position in screen space.
inout vec2**SHADOW_VERTEX** | Same asVERTEXbut can be written to alter shadows.
inout vec3**LIGHT_VERTEX** | Same asVERTEXbut can be written to alter lighting.
Z component represents height.
inout vec4**COLOR** | COLORfrom thevertex()function multiplied by theTEXTUREcolor. Also output color value.

## Light built-ins

Light processor functions work differently in Godot 4.x than they did in Godot
3.x. In Godot 4.x all lighting is done during the regular draw pass. In other
words, Godot no longer draws the object again for each light.

Use the unshaded render mode if you do not want the light() function to
run. Use the light_only render mode if you only want to see the impact of
lighting on an object; this can be useful when you only want the object visible
where it is covered by light.

If you define a light() function it will replace the built-in light function,
even if your light function is empty.

Below is an example of a light shader that takes a CanvasItem's normal map into account:

```
void light() {
  float cNdotL = max(0.0, dot(NORMAL, LIGHT_DIRECTION));
  LIGHT = vec4(LIGHT_COLOR.rgb * COLOR.rgb * LIGHT_ENERGY * cNdotL, LIGHT_COLOR.a);
}
```

## SDF functions

There are a few additional functions implemented to sample an automatically
generated Signed Distance Field texture. These functions available for the fragment()
and light() functions of CanvasItem shaders. Custom functions may also use them as long
as they called from supported functions.

The signed distance field is generated from [LightOccluder2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_lightoccluder2d.html#class-lightoccluder2d) nodes
present in the scene with the **SDF Collision** property enabled (which is the
default). See the <doc:2d_lights_and_shadows#Setting-Up-Shadows>
documentation for more information.

float**texture_sdf**(vec2 sdf_pos) | Performs an SDF texture lookup.
vec2**texture_sdf_normal**(vec2 sdf_pos) | Calculates a normal from the SDF texture.
vec2**sdf_to_screen_uv**(vec2 sdf_pos) | Converts an SDF to screen UV.
