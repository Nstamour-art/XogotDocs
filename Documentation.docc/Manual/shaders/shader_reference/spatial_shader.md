# Spatial shaders

Spatial shaders are used for shading 3D objects. They are the most complex type of shader Godot offers.
Spatial shaders are highly configurable with different render modes and different rendering options
(e.g. Subsurface Scattering, Transmission, Ambient Occlusion, Rim lighting etc). Users can optionally
write vertex, fragment, and light processor functions to affect how objects are drawn.

## Render modes

For visual examples of these render modes, see <doc:standard_material_3d>.

Render mode | Description
----------- | -----------
**blend_mix** | Mix blend mode (alpha is transparency), default.
**blend_add** | Additive blend mode.
**blend_sub** | Subtractive blend mode.
**blend_mul** | Multiplicative blend mode.
**blend_premul_alpha** | Premultiplied alpha blend mode (fully transparent = add, fully opaque = mix).
**depth_draw_opaque** | Only draw depth for opaque geometry (not transparent).
**depth_draw_always** | Always draw depth (opaque and transparent).
**depth_draw_never** | Never draw depth.
**depth_prepass_alpha** | Do opaque depth pre-pass for transparent geometry.
**depth_test_disabled** | Disable depth testing.
**sss_mode_skin** | Subsurface Scattering mode for skin (optimizes visuals for human skin, e.g. boosted red channel).
**cull_back** | Cull back-faces (default).
**cull_front** | Cull front-faces.
**cull_disabled** | Culling disabled (double sided).
**unshaded** | Result is just albedo. No lighting/shading happens in material, making it faster to render.
**wireframe** | Geometry draws using lines (useful for troubleshooting).
**debug_shadow_splits** | Directional shadows are drawn using different colors for each split (useful for troubleshooting).
**diffuse_burley** | Burley (Disney PBS) for diffuse (default).
**diffuse_lambert** | Lambert shading for diffuse.
**diffuse_lambert_wrap** | Lambert-wrap shading (roughness-dependent) for diffuse.
**diffuse_toon** | Toon shading for diffuse.
**specular_schlick_ggx** | Schlick-GGX for direct light specular lobes (default).
**specular_toon** | Toon for direct light specular lobes.
**specular_disabled** | Disable direct light specular lobes. Doesn't affect reflected light (useSPECULAR = 0.0instead).
**skip_vertex_transform** | VERTEX,NORMAL,TANGENT, andBITANGENTneed to be transformed manually in thevertex()function.
**world_vertex_coords** | VERTEX,NORMAL,TANGENT, andBITANGENTare modified in world space instead of model space.
**ensure_correct_normals** | Use when non-uniform scale is applied to mesh(note: currently unimplemented).
**shadows_disabled** | Disable computing shadows in shader. The shader will not receive shadows, but can still cast them.
**ambient_light_disabled** | Disable contribution from ambient light and radiance map.
**shadow_to_opacity** | Lighting modifies the alpha so shadowed areas are opaque and
non-shadowed areas are transparent. Useful for overlaying shadows onto
a camera feed in AR.
**vertex_lighting** | Use vertex-based lighting instead of per-pixel lighting.
**particle_trails** | Enables the trails when used on particles geometry.
**alpha_to_coverage** | Alpha antialiasing mode, seeherefor more.
**alpha_to_coverage_and_one** | Alpha antialiasing mode, seeherefor more.
**fog_disabled** | Disable receiving depth-based or volumetric fog. Useful forblend_addmaterials like particles.

## Built-ins

Values marked as in are read-only. Values marked as out can optionally be written to and will
not necessarily contain sensible values. Values marked as inout provide a sensible default
value, and can optionally be written to. Samplers cannot be written to so they are not marked.

Not all built-ins are available in all processing functions. To access a vertex
built-in from the fragment() function, you can use a <doc:shading_language#Varyings>.
The same applies for accessing fragment built-ins from the light() function.

## Global built-ins

Global built-ins are available everywhere, including custom functions.

Built-in | Description
-------- | -----------
in float**TIME** | Global time since the engine has started, in seconds. It repeats after every3,600seconds (which can  be changed with the
[rollover](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_projectsettings_property_rendering/limits/time/time_rollover_secs.html#class-projectsettings_property_rendering/limits/time/time_rollover_secs)
setting). It's affected by [time_scale](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_engine_property_time_scale.html#class-engine_property_time_scale) but not by pausing.
If you need aTIMEvariable that is not affected by time scale, add your own
<doc:shading_language#Global-Uniforms> and update it each
frame.
in float**PI** | APIconstant (3.141592).
A ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and amount of radians in half turn.
in float**TAU** | ATAUconstant (6.283185).
An equivalent ofPI * 2and amount of radians in full turn.
in float**E** | AnEconstant (2.718281). Euler's number and a base of the natural logarithm.
in bool**OUTPUT_IS_SRGB** | truewhen output is in sRGB color space (this istruein the Compatibility
renderer,falsein Forward+ and Mobile).
in float**CLIP_SPACE_FAR** | Clip space farzvalue.
In the Forward+ or Mobile renderers, it's0.0.
In the Compatibility renderer, it's-1.0.

## Vertex built-ins

Vertex data (VERTEX, NORMAL, TANGENT, and BITANGENT) are presented in model space
(also called local space). If not written to, these values will not be modified and be
passed through as they came, then transformed into view space to be used in fragment().

They can optionally be presented in world space by using the world_vertex_coords render mode.

Users can disable the built-in modelview transform (projection will still happen later) and do
it manually with the following code:

```
shader_type spatial;
render_mode skip_vertex_transform;

void vertex() {
    VERTEX = (MODELVIEW_MATRIX * vec4(VERTEX, 1.0)).xyz;
    NORMAL = normalize((MODELVIEW_MATRIX * vec4(NORMAL, 0.0)).xyz);
    BINORMAL = normalize((MODELVIEW_MATRIX * vec4(BINORMAL, 0.0)).xyz);
    TANGENT = normalize((MODELVIEW_MATRIX * vec4(TANGENT, 0.0)).xyz);
}
```

Other built-ins, such as UV, UV2, and COLOR, are also passed through to the fragment() function if not modified.

Users can override the modelview and projection transforms using the POSITION built-in. If POSITION is written
to anywhere in the shader, it will always be used, so the user becomes responsible for ensuring that it always has
an acceptable value. When POSITION is used, the value from VERTEX is ignored and projection does not happen.
However, the value passed to the fragment shader still comes from VERTEX.

For instancing, the INSTANCE_CUSTOM variable contains the instance custom data. When using particles, this information
is usually:

- **x**: Rotation angle in radians.

- **y**: Phase during lifetime (0.0 to 1.0).

- **z**: Animation frame.

This allows you to easily adjust the shader to a particle system using default particles material. When writing a custom particle
shader, this value can be used as desired.

> Note:
>
> MODELVIEW_MATRIX combines both the MODEL_MATRIX and VIEW_MATRIX and is better suited when floating point issues may arise. For example, if the object is very far away from the world origin, you may run into floating point issues when using the separated MODEL_MATRIX and VIEW_MATRIX.
>

> Note:
>
> INV_VIEW_MATRIX is the matrix used for rendering the object in that pass, unlike MAIN_CAM_INV_VIEW_MATRIX, which is the matrix of the camera in the scene. In the shadow pass, INV_VIEW_MATRIX's view is based on the camera that is located at the position of the light.

## Fragment built-ins

The default use of a Godot fragment processor function is to set up the material properties of your object
and to let the built-in renderer handle the final shading. However, you are not required to use all
these properties, and if you don't write to them, Godot will optimize away the corresponding functionality.

## Light built-ins

Writing light processor functions is completely optional. You can skip the light() function by using
the unshaded render mode. If no light function is written, Godot will use the material properties
written to in the fragment() function to calculate the lighting for you (subject to the render mode).

The light() function is called for every light in every pixel. It is called within a loop for each light type.

Below is an example of a custom light() function using a Lambertian lighting model:

```
void light() {
    DIFFUSE_LIGHT += clamp(dot(NORMAL, LIGHT), 0.0, 1.0) * ATTENUATION * LIGHT_COLOR / PI;
}
```

If you want the lights to add together, add the light contribution to DIFFUSE_LIGHT using +=, rather than overwriting it.
