# Creating script templates

Godot provides a way to use script templates as seen in the
Script Create Dialog while creating a new script:

@Image(source: "script_create_dialog_templates.png")

A set of built-in script templates are provided with the editor, but it is
also possible to create new ones and set them by default, both per project
and at editor scope.

Templates are linked to a specific node type, so when you create a script
you will only see the templates corresponding to that particular node, or
one of its parent types.
For example, if you are creating a script for a CharacterBody3D, you will
only see templates defined for CharacterBody3Ds, Node3Ds or Nodes.

## Locating the templates

There are two places where templates can be managed.

### Editor-defined templates

These are available globally throughout any project. The location of these
templates are determined per each OS:

- Windows: %APPDATA%\Godot\script_templates\

- Linux: $HOME/.config/godot/script_templates/

- macOS: $HOME/Library/Application Support/Godot/script_templates/

If you're getting Godot from somewhere other than the official website, such
as Steam, the folder might be in a different location. You can find it using
the Godot editor. Go to Editor > Open Editor Data/Settings Folder and it
will open a folder in your file browser, inside that folder is the
script_templates folder.

### Project-defined templates

The default path to search for templates is the
res://script_templates/ directory. The path can be changed by configuring the project setting
[Editor > Script > Templates Search Path](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_projectsettings_property_editor/script/templates_search_path.html#class-projectsettings_property_editor/script/templates_search_path),
both via code and the editor.

If no script_templates directory is found within a project, it is simply
ignored.

### Template organization and naming

Both editor and project defined templates are organized in the following way:

```
template_path/node_type/file.extension
```

where:

- template_path is one of the 2 locations discussed in the previous two sections.

- node_type is the node it will apply to (for example, [Node](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node), or [CharacterBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody3d.html#class-characterbody3d)),
This is **case-sensitive**. If a script isn't in the proper node_type folder, it won't be detected.

- file is the custom name you can chose for the template (for example, platformer_movement or smooth_camera).

- extension indicates which language the template will apply to (it should be gd for GDScript or cs for C#).

For example:

- script_templates/Node/smooth_camera.gd

- script_templates/CharacterBody3D/platformer_movement.gd

## Default behavior and overriding it

By default:

- the template's name is the same as the file name (minus the extension, prettyfied)

- the description is empty

- the space indent is set to 4

- the template will not be set as the default for the given node

It is possible to customize this behavior by adding meta headers at the start
of your file, like this:

In this case, the name will be set to "Platformer movement", with the given custom description, and
it will be set as the default template for the node in which directory it has been saved.

This is an example of utilizing custom templates at editor and project level:

> Note: The script templates have the same extension as the regular script
> files. This may lead to an issue of a script parser treating those templates as
> actual scripts within a project. To avoid this, make sure to ignore the
> directory containing them by creating an empty .gdignore file. The directory won't be
> visible throughout the project's filesystem anymore, yet the templates can be
> modified by an external text editor anytime.
>

> Tip:
>
> By default, every C# file inside the project directory is included in the compilation.
> Script templates must be manually excluded from the C# project to avoid build errors.
> See Exclude files from the build in the Microsoft documentation.
>

It is possible to create editor-level templates that have the same level as a project-specific
templates, and also that have the same name as a built-in one, all will be shown on the new script
dialog.

## Default template

To override the default template, create a custom template at editor or project level inside a
Node directory (or a more specific type, if only a subtype wants to be overridden) and start
the file with the meta-default: true header.

Only one template can be set as default at the same time for the same node type.

The Default templates for basic Nodes, for both GDScript and C#, are shown here so you can
use these as the base for creating other templates:

The Godot editor provides a set of useful built-in node-specific templates, such as
basic_movement for both [CharacterBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody2d.html#class-characterbody2d) and
[CharacterBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody3d.html#class-characterbody3d) and plugin for
[EditorPlugin](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_editorplugin.html#class-editorplugin).

## List of template placeholders

The following describes the complete list of built-in template placeholders
which are currently implemented.

### Base placeholders

Placeholder | Description
----------- | -----------
_BINDINGS_NAMESPACE_ | The name of the Godot namespace (used in C# only).
_CLASS_ | The name of the new class.
_CLASS_SNAKE_CASE_ | The name of the new class assnake_case(used in GDScript only).
_BASE_ | The base type a new script inherits from.
_TS_ | Indentation placeholder. The exact type and number
of whitespace characters used for indentation is
determined by thetext_editor/indent/typeandtext_editor/indent/sizesettings in the
[EditorSettings](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_editorsettings.html#class-editorsettings)
respectively. Can be overridden by themeta-space-indentheader on the template.

### Type placeholders

There used to be, in Godot 3.x, placeholders for GDScript type hints that
would get replaced whenever a template was used to create a new script, such as:
%INT_TYPE%, %STRING_TYPE%, %FLOAT_TYPE% or %VOID_RETURN%.

The placeholders no longer work for Godot 4.x, but if the setting
text_editor/completion/add_type_hints from
[EditorSettings](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_editorsettings.html#class-editorsettings) is disabled, type hints
for parameters and return types will be automatically removed for a few
base types:

- int

- String

- Array[String]

- float

- void

- := will be transformed into =
