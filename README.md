# XogotDocs

XogotDocs contains the source documentation for **Xogot**, the iPad and iPhone
port of the Godot Engine developed by [Xibbon, Inc.](https://xibbon.com).  
The documentation is published at [docs.xogot.com](https://docs.xogot.com) using
Apple’s **DocC** documentation system.

---

## Overview

This repository serves as the **authoring and build source** for the Xogot
documentation set.  It combines original Xogot content written in DocC-compatible 
Markdown with material adapted from the open-source 
[Godot Engine documentation](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs), 
originally written in reStructuredText (reST).

All documentation can be edited, previewed, and built in **Xcode**, using the
included `Xogot.xcodeproj` and the `Documentation.docc` bundle as the primary
workspace.

## Repository Structure

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.github/workflows` | GitHub Actions used to automatically build and publish the documentation from the `main` branch. |
| `Documentation.docc/` | The main DocC bundle containing all documentation topics, resources, and metadata. |
| `Xogot.xcodeproj` | The Xcode project used to open, edit, and preview the documentation locally. |
| `Xogot/` | A minimal Swift target that hosts the DocC catalog for Xcode previews. |
| `scripts/` | Conversion and utility scripts for transforming upstream Godot reST files into DocC Markdown. |

---

## Documentation Bundle Layout

Within `Documentation.docc`, the following directories and files are
particularly important:

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Manual/` | Converted from `godot-docs/tutorials`. Contains adapted Godot tutorials. Files remain excluded from publication on [docs.xogot.com](https://docs.xogot.com) until the placeholder comment `<!-- Remove this line to publish to docs.xogot.com -->` is removed. |
| `Tutorials/` | Converted from `godot-docs/getting-started`. Entry-level guides for using Godot features within Xogot. |
| `Resources/` | Contains images, example projects, and other resource files referenced by the documentation. |
| `Releases/` | Includes release notes for TestFlight and App Store versions of Xogot. |
| `Documentation.md` | The top-level table of contents and navigation root for the published documentation. |

Additional articles may appear in the root of `Documentation.docc` and are
gradually being reorganized into subdirectories.

## Building and Previewing

You can build and preview the documentation locally in Xcode.

1. Open `Xogot.xcodeproj`.  
2. Select the **Xogot** scheme.  
3. Choose **Product → Build Documentation** or **Product → Run** to preview in
   the Documentation window.

## Publishing

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically rebuilds and republishes the site from
the `main` branch after each commit.
